My name is Gabriela Medvetska. I do awesome things like:

- I am building a dictionary to develop gender-sensitive terminology in Ukrainian language.
- I am volunteering as an audio-/videoeditor for a project _Books that Talk_ to provide audiobooks for visually impaired children.
- I am so passionate about Ukraine and willing to help others discover it that I also develop a self-study course for learning Ukrainian as a Foreign Language.


### Personal stuff

I have an awesome dog Ronnie JD and genius girlfriend [Valeska](https://github.com/MissValeska) (go on, check out her github too!)
