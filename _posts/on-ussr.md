Based on [this post](http://maxim-nm.livejournal.com/307636.html) written by a Belorussian guy Maxim.

As the author correctly points it out, there are always these articles of USSR supporters who are nostalic about that historical period and would usually write something like, "gosh, if you only knew how good produce was in soviet union! No chemicals, pesticides or other nasty things. It was different from now: natural (organic) sausages, and meat of the highest quality, and super fresh fruit! Ah, and the ice cream!"
Being raised in post-soviet years, only 5 years after the USSR collapsed, obviously, I had first hand experience and exposure to all the nostalgy my grandparents carried over to the modern times as well all the critizism (what mainly this article is about) my father expressed about it.
Soviet Union only seemed great because people had no alternatives and had never seen/experienced any better attitude than communists provided.

In reality, people of soviet union ate whatever they could get from standing in the long lines. All these "natural" products they refer to are being sold even now, but remain unnotice behind some actual high-quality produce. Nowadays only old and lonely elderly people eat "like in USSR," but not because they are trying to stick with that "super healthy" diet, but because they don't have money for anything else.

You may wonder why people want to go back to the USSR, but after this post you will wonder even more.

* Beef

There was almost no normal meat in the USSR. "Traditional" soviet meals included stuff like meatballs that, in contrast to a beef steak, were cooked pretty much from any meat residues and would actually even taste nice if mixed with bread, oil, and spices.
In the late soviet era, even such crappy "meatballs'" meat was in shortage, but people would still stay in long lines to get it.

Here is a picture that demonstrates atmosphere of the meat section of those years. 
A typical scenario: 
A couple of meat pieces was "trown" into the section, some random guy asks the cashier to give him a piece that he thinks might be better, pointing at it with his finger, but she gives him a weird piece with something like "Sir! Take this otherwise you get none!" So this is that "natural-organic-fresh" soviet meat.
Would you want to try it?

* Poultry

At section of frozen poultry, a man is examining the product. Chicken in USSR was pretty (as you might have guessed) crappy too, not edible and suitable for soup only (super thin and blue colored), often sold with feet and wings (to increase weight) and in a super frozen state.

It's interesting that even such chicken was in shortage, and, again, people would still push each other in lines. Howeverm it was more or less easier to get chicken subproducts (yes, modern petfood - beaks, feet, necks, wattles, and combs).
