It's hard and, moreover, inefficient to keep all information that can be stored elsewhere, in your head. Especially when Bookmars are full of websites some of which are not even working anymore. Thus, I am creating this list of resources I extensively use and will continue updating it as soon as I find anything else interesting/useful enough.

Here we go! [^1]

* [Mozilla Developer Network][https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/]
* [A book about Eloquent JS][http://eloquentjavascript.net/]
* [JS Fiddle for a real-time connected web authoring][https://jsfiddle.net/]
* [A book about JS patterns][https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/]
* [Google for Education][https://developers.google.com/edu/]

[^1] This list does not support sorting/filtering by any means.
